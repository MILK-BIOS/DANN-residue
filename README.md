# DANN for Corn Stover Project

## Overview
This project utilizes Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) to address the issue of corn stover detection in agricultural fields. Corn stover, the residual plant material left in the field after the corn harvest, plays a crucial role in soil health and overall crop sustainability. The objective is to employ DANN to enhance the accuracy of corn stover detection in satellite or drone imagery.
